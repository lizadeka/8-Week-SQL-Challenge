## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Danny is a big fan of Japanese food, and in early 2021 he decided to open a small restaurant, Dannyâ€™s Diner, serving his three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen.
The diner has been running for a few months and has collected some basic sales and customer data. However, Danny is unsure how to interpret this data to improve his business.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Danny wants to analyze the data to gain insights into his customersâ€™ behavior, such as:
- Their visiting patterns
- How much they have spent overall
- Which menu items are the most popular

By answering these questions, Danny hopes to:
- Build stronger relationships with his loyal customers through personalized experiences.
- Decide whether to expand the customer loyalty program.
- Generate easy-to-use datasets for his team so they donâ€™t always rely on SQL for quick analysis.

## Dataset

The case study is centered around three tables:

- sales â€“ Records of customer orders
- menu â€“ Menu items and their prices
- members â€“ Customers who joined the loyalty program
