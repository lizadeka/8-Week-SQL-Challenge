## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Danny, a pizza enthusiast, wanted to start a pizza delivery business. However, instead of managing everything traditionally, he recruited a group of runners who would pick up pizzas and deliver them to customers. 
Danny stored all order, customer, and runner information in a relational database.
Now, Danny wants to analyze his business operations using SQL to answer key questions about customers, orders, deliveries, and performance.

## ðŸ§¾ Problem Statement

Danny wants to gain clear insights into his growing pizza business, including:

Menu Insights â†’ Which pizzas and extras are most popular?

Runner Performance â†’ How efficient is each runner in terms of delivery success and timing?

Operational Optimization â†’ Where can delivery operations be improved to reduce delays and failed deliveries?

The goal is to clean, transform, and analyze the data using SQL, enabling Pizza Runner to make better business decisions and optimize logistics.

## Dataset

The case study is centered around three tables:

- runners â€“ Information about each delivery runner and their registration date

- customer_orders â€“ Records of pizza orders placed by customers, including extras and exclusions

- runner_orders â€“ Delivery data with timestamps, pickup/drop info, and cancellations

- pizza_names â€“ Mapping between pizza IDs and their names

- pizza_recipes â€“ Recipe details showing which toppings are used in each pizza

- pizza_toppings â€“ Full list of available toppings and their unique IDs
